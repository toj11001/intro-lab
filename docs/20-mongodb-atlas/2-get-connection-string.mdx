# üëê Get Your Connection String

The dataset has already been loaded into the cluster. You will need to get the connection string the cluster and your database and username.

The connection string should look something like this:

```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/
```

For this demo the we are connecting with the cluster `democluster.9kkxj.mongodb.net`.

The username and password are the same and of the following format `devday1`, `devday2`, etc.

Therefore the first users connection string with look like this: `mongodb+srv://devday1:devday1@democluster.9kkxj.mongodb.net/`
