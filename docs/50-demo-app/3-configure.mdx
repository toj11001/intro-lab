# üëê Configure the Application

Now that your environment is set up, you can configure the application.

There should already be a file open in the IDE. If not, look in the file explorer on the left, and open the file `server/.env`. This file contains the configuration for the application.

The file should look like this:

```bash
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URI="mongodb+srv://user:password@serverurl"
DATABASE_NAME="library"
SECRET="secret"
```

You'll need to change the `DATABASE_URI` parameter to match your connection string. That's the same one you used to import the data.

:::tip
Don't remember how to get your connection string? Check out the [Import Data](/docs/mongodb-atlas/get-connection-string) section.
:::

Copy and paste your connection string into the `DATABASE_URI` parameter. The file will automatically save, and the server will restart.

In the *Terminal* tab at the bottom, look for the `Server is running on port: 5000` line. If you see it, you're good to go!

## Reload the client

Now that the server is running, you can reload the client to see the application.

In the upper right panel, click the refresh icon to reload the client.

Clicking this will reload the client, which should now be connected to the database. You should see the application with some books listed now.
